Description: In the Cox model, partial likelihood, represented as a product of conditional probabilities, is a standard tool for estimating regression coefficients. Typically, these conditional probabilities are approximated by risk score ratios within a continuous-time framework, producing estimates based on an approximate PL. ExactCoxPBD revisits the foundational concept of partial likelihood by providing an exact computation method for the Cox model, leveraging the Poisson-binomial distribution to precisely calculate conditional probabilities. This approach is particularly effective for datasets with many ties or high variability in covariates.
